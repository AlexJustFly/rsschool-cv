**3.** My goal is to become a front-end developer. Why do I want this? The answer is simple - I like it. I enjoy the process of creating something, whether it is a simple site page or a full-fledged application. In my understanding, programming is partly creative, but at the same time a serious process that requires good preparation and confident knowledge. For me, these courses are quite an important stage in my life. I went to this for quite a long time and the further I went, the more I understood that it makes no sense to stop. I firmly decided that in any case I will achieve my goal - it is only a matter of time. What am I ready to do for this? Do my best and study hard day and night until i reach my goal. But this does not mean that after reaching the goal, I will give up everything. After all, I am so accustomed to learning that it has already become my habit :smile:.
